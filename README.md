# Sports Store

My First project based in asp.net core 3.0

Thanks to *Adam Freeman* and his book *Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 2* for making me understand the basic of .net core.

## Changes from specifications provided in then book
* Used LibMan instead of bower, as .net core team has dropped support for bower from AspNetCore2.0 onwards.
* Used SqlExpress instead of localdb, as i'm more likely into using SSMS instead of managind db with visual studio.

## Environment details
* Using Virtual machine created with azure
* Visual Studio Community 2019
* SQL Express 2019
* Planning to depoly the appusing azure web apps
